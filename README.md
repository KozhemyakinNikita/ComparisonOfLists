# ComparisonOfLists
Compare performance of ArrayList and LinkedList

It is necessary to write code that would call the main methods of collections a certain (1000 or 2000, or any other) number of times. In this case, the time must be recorded.

The minimum required methods to test are: add, delete, get

After that, display a table with the results (method, how many times it was executed, execution time)
